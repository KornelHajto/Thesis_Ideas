* Introduction
This document presents a curated list of advanced and challenging thesis topics spanning software development, cybersecurity, gaming, and web scraping. Emphasizing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, quantum computing, and ethical computing, these ideas reflect recent research trends and industry needs. Projects range from advanced threat intelligence systems and post-quantum cryptography implementations to innovative, privacy-conscious web scraping techniques. The goal is to inspire research that combines technical rigor with practical impact.

* 1. AI-Driven Anti-Cheat Systems for Multiplayer Games
** Motivation
Cheating in multiplayer games undermines fair play, damages community trust, and causes substantial financial losses. Modern cheat tools increasingly leverage AI (e.g., AI-powered aimbots), evolving faster than conventional detection methods. Traditional heuristics and rule-based anti-cheat systems struggle to keep pace with such sophisticated attacks.

** Research Objective
Develop an adaptive AI-based anti-cheat system that detects cheating behavior by analyzing in-game telemetry data, such as mouse movements, aiming patterns, and player statistics (kill/death ratios), identifying subtle anomalies indicative of cheating.

** Methodology
- Collect large-scale, anonymized gameplay telemetry data.
- Design and train machine learning models to classify player behavior patterns, distinguishing legitimate from malicious actions.
- Employ federated learning to allow model training across decentralized player devices, preserving privacy and reducing central data aggregation risks.
- Validate detection accuracy with real-world datasets and controlled cheat simulations.

** Expected Contributions
- A novel, privacy-preserving framework for anti-cheat detection.
- Demonstration of federated learning applicability in real-time gaming environments.
- Enhanced robustness against evolving AI-driven cheats.
